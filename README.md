# TwinBERT-schema_matching

## Contribution

* We devise TwinBERT, a transformer-based approach to integrate SQL representation with schema representation, for effective schema matching problem.
* We present SchemaBERT to provide a paradigm for handling schema matching tasks, which can boost the performance by introducing an understanding of the table to which attributes belong.
* We propose a method of using SQL knowledge learned from the database query log to improve neural database schema matching performance.To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to leverage anonymized SQL query logs for improving the performance of neural schema matcher.
* We conduct a thorough evaluation on 6 datasets for schema matching task, which includes a Harduni dataset that we constructed. Extensive experiments show that TwinBERT outperforms the state-of-the-art models on most tasks and on average.
